v0.23 2021-10-20 small improvements
v0.24 2022-05-05 Phillip Eaton went at it again :-)
                 Fix for https://github.com/Arakula/dasmfw/issues/6
                   Info file lines with in-line comments were not processed correctly.
                   From now on, if a * appears in the line that does NOT start the
                   comment part, it has to be prefixed with a \ to be processed.
                 Added upmnemo {on|off|default} option in response to
                   https://github.com/Arakula/dasmfw/issues/4
                 Fix for https://github.com/Arakula/dasmfw/issues/5
                 Slight 650X improvements
v0.25 2022-05-06 [no]code option documented
                 [no]labeleqs option documented
                 Slight changes to info file handling against v0.24 as
                   neither "option cchar *" nor "option cchar \*" worked <sigh> ...
                   now it should work as documented and it's "option cchar \*"
v0.26 2022-05-09 upmnemo option now also influences register names
                 Updates to 6502 disassembler
v0.27 2022-05-10 relc directive added
v0.28 2022-05-18 crude fix for https://github.com/Arakula/dasmfw/issues/8
                   added 2 options for the 680X and 650X disassemblers to set
                   up a pattern for forced direct(zeropage) and extended(absolute)
                   addressing
v0.29 2022-05-20 "option offset,begin,end,bus,interleave" info file statements preceding
                   a "file" statement should work now
v0.30 2022-06-06 Updates to 6502 disassembler
